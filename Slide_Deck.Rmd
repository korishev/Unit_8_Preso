Greetings Mr. CEO and Mr. CFO, other distinguished guests.

Given the Beer and Brewery data, our research intends to answer several compelling questions for the business:
1. How many breweries are present in each state?
```{r import beer data}
beers <- read.csv("Beers.csv")
breweries <- read.csv("Breweries.csv")

# Question 2
# Merge beer data with the breweries data. 
# Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.

# Merge the two data frames into one
data <- merge(beers,breweries,by.x = "Brewery_id", by.y = "Brew_ID")
data <- data %>% 
  rename(Beer = Name.x) %>%       # clean up munged names from merge
  rename(Brewery = Name.y) %>%    # clean up munged names from merge
  rename(Brewery_ID = Brewery_id) # Make anything with _ID the same

head(data, n = 6)                 # First six from merged set
tail(data,n = 6)                  # Last six from merged set

```

```{r Breweries per State}

While accurate this graphic is less than helpful, so we've put the breweries on a map.


To perform the rest of the analysis, the data was checked for a number of inconsistencies including missing values.  Over half of the records(1405 of 2410) in the dataset did not have values for the IBU, and 62 of the entries did not have a value for ABV.

To allow us to continue without removing any of the records for missing values, it was decided to impute the data with a k-NN on beers in the same "Style".  What this means is that for a given beer, the algorithm will look at the collection of beers, find ones that match with it best, determine an appropriate IBU or ABV value, and replace the missing value in the sample.


```{r impute data}
# use the knnImputation() function from the Date Mining with R (DMwR) library to fill in missing data
# this method uses the available information in the remainder of the data frame to establish a kNN 
# relationship and fill in missing values
adjData <- data %>% knnImputation()
```

The summary statistics of the ABV by state show a minimum ABV of 0.001, or 0.1% Alcohol by Volume.  This is either a data collection error or a set of Non-Alcoholic beers. The maximum ABV is 12.8%, and the mean ABV is 5.9% with 50% of the beers in the sample ranging from 5.0% to 6.7%.  A case could be made to discard the beers with minimum ABV as "not-beers" but rather "beer-like-beverages", as they are not subject to the same laws regulating the sale of alcoholic beverages.  Alternately, many persons are not allowed to drink alcohol because of religious beliefs or medical reasons, so it may be worth while to keep the non-alcoholic beers in the study.
```{r summary stats of abv}
adjData %>% select(ABV) %>% summary()
```
The distribution of Alcohol by Volume peaks at 5.9%, and shows a right skew, indicating that the set of beers sampled show a tendency to start at around 5% ABV, with a large grouping of beers in that 5.0%-6.7%, then a long tail reaching into higher and higher ABV numbers.  Fewer beers were below the 5.0% ABV mark.  From this graph, the distribution of ABV in beers appears to be more logarithmic than normal.
```{r histogram of ABV, large binwidth}
adjData %>% filter(!is.na(ABV)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=ABV)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),binwidth = 0.005, na.rm = TRUE, show.legend = TRUE) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.2, fill="#FF6666", color="red")
```
The Boxplot of ABV gives a better look at the number of outliers on each end of the ABV values.  Below the bottom whisker, we see a small number of outliers near 0.1% ABV, with many more outliers above the top whisker ranging from about 6.7% to 13%  ABV.
```{r boxplot of ABV}
adjData %>% filter(!is.na(ABV)) %>% ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y=ABV))
```
Another interesting point about the histogram, the values of ABV do not appear to be purely continuous.  Instead, if we choose a smaller bin width on the ABV values, we can see a definite trend to have a beer with a specific ABV.
```{r histogram of ABV, small binwidth}
adjData %>% filter(!is.na(ABV)) %>% ggplot(aes(x=ABV)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..),binwidth = 0.001, na.rm = TRUE, show.legend = TRUE) +
  geom_density(alpha=0.2, fill="#FF6666", color="red")
```
Plotting ABU vs. ABV as dots, then adding a linear model regression line shows an "up and to the right" correlation between IBU and ABV.
```{r relationship between IBU and ABV}
adjData %>% select(c(IBU, ABV)) %>% ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=IBU, y=ABV), position = "jitter", na.rm = TRUE) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=IBU, y=ABV), method="lm", na.rm = TRUE)
```
A more concrete indication of this correlation is given by a different plot.  Here, we are shown that the correlation is 0.67, or 67%.  While this shows a correlation, it is not a "strong" one, as there is a lot of variance between IBU and ABV.
```{r ggpairs of IBU v. ABV}
adjData %>% select(c(IBU,ABV)) %>% ggpairs()
```
